# Statistical Arbitrage Pairs Configuration
# 
# Define pairs of correlated markets to monitor for spread divergence.
# When the spread exceeds entry_threshold, a signal is generated.
#
# Format:
#   - market_a_id: First market condition ID
#     market_b_id: Second market condition ID
#     name: Human-readable name for the pair
#     correlation: 1.0 for same direction, -1.0 for inverse correlation

pairs:
  # Example pairs - replace with actual market IDs from Polymarket
  # You can find market IDs using: pmq sync && pmq scan
  
  # - market_a_id: "0x1234567890abcdef..."
  #   market_b_id: "0xfedcba0987654321..."
  #   name: "Example pair - Market A vs Market B"
  #   correlation: 1.0
  
  # Inverse correlation example (market A up = market B down)
  # - market_a_id: "0xabc..."
  #   market_b_id: "0xdef..."
  #   name: "Inverse pair example"
  #   correlation: -1.0
